# Tesla-Charger
Reverse Engineering of the Tesla 10Kw charger and development of an open source control board.

19/10/17 : Uploaded two files : 
ph_frames.csv this file contains the 3 messages required to run phase module 1 in the Gen 2 charger
power_run_ph1.csv this is a capture of phase 1 starting up , ramping up to 8.5A DC 320VDC, 15.5A AC, 230v 50hz
Mains switched manually around message number 700 in ph_frames.csv


21/10/17 : Uploaded two files : 
power_run_ph1_arduino_2a_365vdc.csv
Tesla_chg1_1.ino
Crude arduino sketch to run one power module in the gen2 charger. Runs on an arduino due on CAN1


01/11/17 : Uploaded design files for Version 1 open source logic board for the Tesla Gen 2 charger. As of this date this design is totally unchecked and untested. Do not build this. It could blow up your house , car or cat. Based on the Arduino Due SAM3X8E microcontroller. Stay tuned.


05/11/17 : Updated Design files and PCBs ordered for prototype builds.

17/11/17 : BOM uploaded for the V1 board.


08/12/17 : Added Tesla_charger_Tom_v2_test.ino source file. Should run all 3 phases with the V1 logic board. Untested.

20/12/17 : Added design files for V2 Charger control board. Major changes :

Added 2M Serial EEPROM for parameter storage

Changed to a Vertical type B USB socket.


23/11/19 : Updated BOM for V4 with corrections.
27/02/18 : Error found on the V2 board. Missing grounds on Q1 and D5. Affects EVSE control only. Will ammend in a rev3 board asap.

28/02/18 : V3 design files released with grounds fixed. Also new S/W thanks to Tom DeBree released but untested as of today. Also pictures of mod required on V1 and V2 boards.

02/05/18 : V3 board and new software tested and working in my BMW E31 project car.

03/01/19 : Added an excellent user manual for the V3 logic board compiled by EVWest.

20/01/19 : Added a Beta Software directory to the Repo. Major changes as of this date :


-Stop sending power module can messages when charger not running - Working.


-Correct reading of charger Fault and Enable feedback signals - Working.


-Correct AC present flag so only sets if more than 70V AC is on each module - Working.


-Reset charger on detection of power module fault - Testing.


-Shutdown on exceeding a preset HV Battery voltage - Working. 


-Evse read routine now in 500ms loop to prevent false triggering -Working.



Recommend using this version.

27/01/19 : Added counter/timer to autoshutdown routine to prevent false triggering on transients.

06/02/19 : On request by a customer:

Added manual control mode for use of charger without EVSE. Digital one in when brought to +12v commands the charger to start
and when brought low commands charger off.

This mode also control HVDC via digital out 1 and AC mains via a contactor via Digital out 2.-Untested as of this date.

19/06/19 : Added schematic for V4 logic board design. V4 has the following upgrades over V3 :

-Changed from Type B USB to Mini. This will allow the charger lid to close without modification.

-Added extra stage of filtering to proximity signal.

-Single wire CAN capability added using the NCV7356. Now uses the exact same switching method between pwm control pilot and sw can as used in the Tesla charger / bms boards. This will allow use of Tesla destination charging, Chademo adapter,CCS adapter and possibly supercharging. All software dependent.

-Added two high power DC low side contactor drivers for use with DC fast charge or as general outputs.

-Added 3rd CAN channel based around the MCP2517 controller. Allows for high speed as well as FD Can. This extra can channel will allow the Tesla charger to act as a Chademo controller. Just add contactors and a hall current sensor.

-Two extra filtered and protected 12v digital inputs. General use or chademo control.

-One extra filtered and protected analog input. General use or hall current sensor for chademo control.

Untested as of this date.


Enjoy!

23/11/19 : Updated BOM for V4 with corrections.

21/01/2020 : New V5 design based on the STM32F103C8T6 now released. Note that as of today no firmware is developed. Anyone want to lend a hand?

18/02/20 : Beata firmware for the V5 board released. Untested as of this release due to hardware delay. Uses ST CUBEIDE.

14.03/20 : ESP8266 based web interface for the V5 charger board using Olimex module. Firmware uploaded. Untested as of release. Bench tests on V5 hardware looking good. One software bug discovered.


12/07/20 : 

Update : V5 software debugging now done.

-EEPROM saving of parameters now working.

-Autoshutdown on exceeding termination voltage parameter now working. 

-WiFi now working

-Correct reporting of voltage and current values over wifi and serial

-Robust reading of pilot pwm current setting. Was very noise prone.

Still todo : 

- Add support for the alternate CAN messaging in some chargers.

Release :

As stated previously due to the lack of engagement / support by the community I employed a developer to debug the firmware at some considerable financial cost and my own time in testing. As such the source for this and further updates will be available to Patrons on Patreon only as of now.

This may change in the future. Binaries are freely available on Github and all boards bought from the EVBMW store will be shipped with this version.

29/12/20 : Added pdf schematics, board layout and Gerbers for the V5 Block 2 boards (latest release).

24/02/21 : Added pdf schematics, board layout and Gerbers for the V5 Block 3 boards (latest release). Some design improvements to take advantage of the new Openinverter based firmware :
